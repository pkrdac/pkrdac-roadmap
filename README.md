# PKRDAC Roadmap

EOS Poker has been one of the well designed and popular dApps on EOS. However, EOS Poker recently ceased development operations.

PokerDAC grew out of the EOS Poker Community as a Decentralized Autonomous Community (DAC) owned casino.

PokerDAC’s core mission will be to build a foundation of casino-based EOSIO smart contract protocols. All casino games hosted by PokerDAC will have decentralized authority via its elected custodians and community-owned liquidity bankrolls. Developer bounty programs and community initiative rewards will be implemented through PokerDAC’s internal Worker Proposal System (WPS).
